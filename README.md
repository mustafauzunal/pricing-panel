# Pricing Table ✅

**Simple, responsive pricing component built with plain HTML & CSS.**

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

A lightweight, single-page **pricing table** UI component. Ideal for showcasing pricing tiers (e.g., Basic / Pro / Enterprise) in static websites or prototypes. No build tools or frameworks required — just open `index.html` in a browser.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `index.html` — the pricing table markup
- `app.css` — styles for layout and appearance
- `icons/` — SVG/icon assets used in the UI

> Note: File names/structure are minimal and easy to extend.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Open the project folder in your editor (e.g., VS Code).
2. To view locally, just open `index.html` in your browser, or run a simple local server:

```bash
# From the project root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Or use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code and click "Go Live".

## 🔧 Development

- Edit `index.html` to change content or structure.
- Edit `app.css` to tweak colors, spacing, layout and responsiveness.
- Add or replace icons in the `icons/` folder.

Tips:

- Keep styles modular and use CSS variables for theme tweaks.
- Test responsiveness by resizing your browser or using device emulation in DevTools.

## 📦 Deployment

This is a static site — best hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host:

- For GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages in repository settings.

## ✅ Accessibility & Testing

- Verify keyboard navigation (tab order) and focus states.
- Check color contrast for readability.
- Test on multiple screen sizes to ensure the table adapts gracefully.
